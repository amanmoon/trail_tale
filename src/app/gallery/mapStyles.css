Leaflet creates panes with class names like 'leaflet-<paneName>-pane'.
Since we named our pane 'labels', the class is 'leaflet-labels-pane'.

/*
  Note on GeoJSON feature styling (like countries):
  Leaflet's L.Path options (fillColor, weight, opacity, etc.) are typically applied
  via JavaScript objects passed to layer.setStyle() or as options during GeoJSON creation.
  While SVG elements (which Leaflet uses for GeoJSON) can be styled with CSS,
  Leaflet's direct JS API for styling these paths is often more straightforward
  and powerful for dynamic updates. The HIGHLIGHT_STYLE and INITIAL_GEOJSON_STYLE
  objects in the JavaScript code serve this purpose.
